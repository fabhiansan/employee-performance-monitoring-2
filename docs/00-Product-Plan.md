 # Product Plan & Implementation Status
 
 ## 1) Context & Problem
 Organizations track employee performance in spreadsheets or ad‑hoc files. This creates friction for managers who need fast, trustworthy insights for reviews and coaching. Pain points:
 - Data is scattered, inconsistent, and hard to aggregate.
 - Manual cleaning and formatting consume hours and introduce errors.
 - Trends across competencies and employees are difficult to see.
 - Performance summaries are inconsistent across managers.
 
 ## 2) Objectives (Outcomes)
 - Reduce time from data import to actionable insight to minutes, not hours.
 - Standardize how performance data is viewed and summarized.
 - Provide a simple flow to resolve data inconsistencies (e.g., employee name mismatches).
 - Enable repeatable comparisons across datasets (versioned snapshots).
 
 ## 3) Users & Personas
 - People Manager: prepares 1:1s and performance reviews; needs fast, clear insights.
 - HR/People Ops: aggregates team data; needs consistency and comparability.
 - Team Lead: identifies coaching opportunities and skill gaps quickly.
 
 ## 4) Core Jobs-to-be-Done
 - "When I receive a new spreadsheet of scores, I want to quickly load and trust the data so I can start conversations with my team."
 - "When reviewing a person, I want a clear view of strengths, gaps, and a concise summary I can refine."
 - "When comparing across time, I want to see what changed without hunting through files."
 
 ## 5) User Stories (Epics → Stories with Acceptance Criteria)
 
 ### Epic A: Data Import & Preparation
 - Story A1: As a manager, I can import a delimited file (CSV/TSV) and preview how fields map so I can confirm correctness.
   - Acceptance: Given a valid file, a preview shows headers, sample rows, and detected employees; user can confirm or cancel.
 - Story A2: As a manager, I can handle quoted fields, escaped quotes, and bracketed employee names without manual fixes.
   - Acceptance: Import gracefully parses those patterns; malformed rows are surfaced for review.
 - Story A3: As a manager, I can map textual ratings (e.g., "Baik") to numeric scores using provided defaults I can adjust.
   - Acceptance: A simple mapping step exists; changes apply consistently to the dataset.
 
 ### Epic B: Data Validation & Resolution
 - Story B1: As a manager, I can resolve duplicate or mismatched employee names during import.
   - Acceptance: A guided dialog lists conflicts and lets me merge, rename, or ignore with clear results.
 - Story B2: As a manager, I can see validation warnings (missing scores, out-of-range values) and decide how to proceed.
   - Acceptance: Warnings are visible with counts and affected rows; user can continue or fix.
 
 ### Epic C: Insights & Exploration
 - Story C1: As a manager, I can see an overview (key stats and distributions) immediately after import.
   - Acceptance: Overview displays total employees, competency averages, and performance distribution.
 - Story C2: As a user, I can filter, search, and sort employees to find who needs attention.
   - Acceptance: Name search, basic filters, and sorting work together without page reloads.
 - Story C3: As a user, I can open an employee view to see scores by competency and relative strengths/gaps.
   - Acceptance: A per‑employee view shows competencies, scores, and a concise interpretation.
 
 ### Epic D: Summaries & Communication
 - Story D1: As a manager, I can generate a draft performance summary for an employee to refine and save.
   - Acceptance: A draft is generated on demand; I can edit and save it with the record.
 - Story D2: As a user, I can export data and/or summaries for sharing with stakeholders.
   - Acceptance: Export produces a commonly used format suitable for sharing.
 
 ### Epic E: Dataset Management
 - Story E1: As a user, I can save the current dataset as a versioned snapshot and switch between versions later.
   - Acceptance: Saved datasets appear in a list with timestamps/names; switching updates views consistently.
 - Story E2: As a user, I can delete a dataset version I no longer need.
   - Acceptance: Delete confirms and removes the version from lists and views.
 
 ## 6) Assumptions & Constraints (Non-technical)
 - Single operator at a time; collaboration can be asynchronous through exports.
 - Input data comes primarily from HR exports with stable structures but occasional anomalies.
 - Privacy: data remains local to the operator’s environment by default.
 
 ## 7) Scope & Phasing
 - MVP: Import → Validate/Resolve → Overview → Employee view → Save dataset → Export summaries.
 - V1: Enhanced filters, editable rating mappings, basic change-over-time comparison.
 - Future: Collaboration features, multi-tenant governance, deeper analytics.
 
 ## 8) Success Metrics
 - Time-to-first-insight: import to overview visible (target: minutes).
 - Import success rate without manual fixes (target: >90% on supported formats).
 - Share/Export usage per dataset (proxy for downstream utility).
 - Summary adoption rate (percentage of employees with saved summaries).
 
 ## 9) Risks & Mitigations
 - Data quality variance → Mitigation: preview + validation + conflict resolution.
 - Inconsistent rating schemes → Mitigation: adjustable mapping step with sensible defaults.
 - Adoption risk (learning curve) → Mitigation: simple, guided flows and clear empty/loading states.
 - Privacy concerns → Mitigation: local-first approach and explicit export actions.
 
 ## 10) Open Questions & Validation Plan
 - What rating taxonomies are most common (numeric vs. categorical)?
 - Do managers prefer side-by-side comparisons or time-series rollups?
 - What export formats are mandatory for HR workflows?
 - Validation: usability tests with 5–8 managers; pilot with real datasets; measure time-to-first-insight and error rates.
 
 ## 11) High-Level Timeline (Tentative)
 - Week 1–2: Import/validation flows and mapping step.
 - Week 3: Overview and employee views; filtering/search.
 - Week 4: Summaries and export; dataset versioning; polish.
