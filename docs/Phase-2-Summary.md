# Phase 2 Implementation Summary

## Overview
Completed full analytics dashboard and employee management features, bringing the application from 50% to 75% MVP completion.

## What Was Built

### 1. Navigation Infrastructure
- **React Router v7** integration with protected routes
- **Layout component** with persistent sidebar navigation
- **Dataset-aware routing** - navigation automatically includes dataset context
- Routes:
  - `/import` - CSV import wizard
  - `/dashboard/:datasetId` - Performance analytics dashboard
  - `/employees/:datasetId` - Employee list with search
  - `/employees/:datasetId/:employeeId` - Individual employee detail

### 2. Backend Analytics (Rust + SQLite)

#### `get_dataset_stats` Command
Returns comprehensive dataset analytics:
- Total employees, competencies, and scores
- Overall average performance score
- Score distribution across 5 ranges (0-1, 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4+)
- Per-competency statistics (avg score, employee count)
- Optimized SQL with joins and aggregations

#### `list_employees` Command
Searchable, paginated employee list:
- Full-text search on employee names
- Computed average scores per employee
- Score count per employee
- Pagination support (limit/offset)
- Ordered results

#### `get_employee_performance` Command
Detailed individual analysis:
- All competency scores with full metadata
- Automatic identification of top 3 strengths
- Automatic identification of bottom 3 development areas
- Overall average score calculation
- Sorted by competency display order

### 3. Dashboard Page (Epic C - Story C1)
**Key Metrics Cards:**
- Total Employees
- Average Score (overall)
- Total Competencies
- Total Scores

**Visualizations (Recharts):**
- Score Distribution Bar Chart - shows employee count per score range
- Competency Performance Horizontal Bar Chart - top 8 competencies by avg score

**Detailed Table:**
- All competencies with average scores
- Color-coded performance indicators (green ≥3, yellow ≥2, red <2)
- Employee participation count per competency

**Quick Actions:**
- Navigate to employee list
- Import new dataset

### 4. Employee List Page (Epic C - Story C2)
**Search Functionality:**
- Real-time search with 300ms debounce
- Filters employees by name
- Updates results automatically

**Employee Table:**
- Name, NIP, Jabatan columns
- Color-coded average score badges
- Score count display
- Click-through to detail view

**Empty States:**
- No employees found
- No data imported

### 5. Employee Detail Page (Epic C - Story C3)
**Employee Header:**
- Avatar icon
- Name, jabatan, NIP display
- Average score card

**Employee Information Card:**
- NIP, Golongan, Jabatan, Sub Jabatan

**Competency Profile:**
- Radar chart showing all competency scores
- Interactive Recharts visualization
- Handles competencies with missing scores

**Performance Insights:**
- **Strengths** - Top 3 competencies with green badges
- **Development Areas** - Bottom 3 competencies with red badges

**Detailed Scores Table:**
- All competencies listed
- Raw text values from CSV
- Numeric scores with color-coded badges
- Competency descriptions

## Technical Highlights

### Type Safety
- Full TypeScript coverage
- Types match Rust backend models exactly
- Proper `ScoreWithCompetency` structure with nested score/competency

### Performance
- Debounced search (300ms delay)
- Efficient SQL queries with indexes
- Lazy loading of employee details
- Loading skeletons for all async operations

### Code Quality
- ✅ All ESLint rules passing (config files have expected warnings)
- ✅ All TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Rust `cargo check` passing
- ✅ Production build successful

### UI/UX
- Consistent design system using shadcn/ui components
- Responsive layout (mobile-friendly)
- Color-coded performance indicators
- Loading states and error handling
- Empty state messages
- Back navigation breadcrumbs

## Files Created/Modified

### New Frontend Files
- `src/pages/ImportPage.tsx` - Moved from App.tsx
- `src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx` - New analytics dashboard
- `src/pages/EmployeeListPage.tsx` - New employee list
- `src/pages/EmployeeDetailPage.tsx` - New employee detail
- `src/components/Layout.tsx` - New navigation layout

### New Backend Files
- `src-tauri/src/commands/analytics.rs` - 3 new analytics commands

### Modified Files
- `src/main.tsx` - Router setup
- `src/types/models.ts` - New analytics types
- `src/lib/api.ts` - New API wrappers
- `src-tauri/src/commands/mod.rs` - Register analytics module
- `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` - Register analytics commands
- `docs/00-Product-Plan.md` - Status update

## Usage Flow

1. **Import CSV** → Navigate to `/import`
2. **Select File** → Preview data and configure ratings
3. **Import Complete** → Click "View Dashboard"
4. **Dashboard** → See overall metrics, charts, competency breakdown
5. **View Employees** → Search and filter employee list
6. **Employee Detail** → Click any employee to see:
   - Radar chart of all competencies
   - Strengths and development areas
   - Full competency breakdown

## Next Steps (Phase 3)

### Validation Engine (Epic B)
- Detect duplicate employee names during import
- Flag missing scores
- Identify invalid rating values
- Conflict resolution dialogs

### Export Features (Epic D)
- Generate performance summaries
- Export to Excel (.xlsx)
- Export to PDF
- Export to CSV

### Dataset Management (Epic E - UI)
- Dataset switcher in header
- Compare multiple datasets
- Delete datasets

## Performance Metrics

### Build Stats
